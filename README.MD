# Grading 10.30.20 

### Brayden(20/20) -
I implemented some more pictures and I added a cool backgrouund. I helped with the menu and I switched from repl to IntelliJ. I used GitHub to share my code and transfer the code from Repl and VS Code to IntelliJ.Added more python lists this week
I implemented a background onto our webpage.I did some coding with Raspberry Pi and I was able to code a light going on and off with GPIO pins in the Pi. I used VNC and that made less cables and wires around so that was more convenient. I added to the broken README so that it is easier to see how we hit all the requirements and see what we all did 
I added the icons to the home page and made them links to different pages. I did implement the contents of the mini lab talk to my intelliJ and VScode project personal playground


### Ryan(19/20) - Add to read.me, fix what was missing from last week
I Fixed spacing for “tired of shopping? Click Below!” section. Change "other" section, make more interesting. Brought my playground to github, then brought it to intellij. I also brought the group project to intellij as well. Added more pictures to the jokes file. Made 2 more commits to github. I gave myself a point off because I did not complete my goal  of fixing the drop down menu for the "tired of shopping? Click Below!" section.



### Billy(20/20) -
Goal for the week:
-Add links to the Shopping Cart, Main, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert pages that reroute the user to the home page
- start work on the shopping cart and add foods and prices to it
Did I achieve my goals?: Yes I finsihed the Shopping Cart links and I added foods and Prices to the foods in the Shopping Cart. 


### Lola(19/20)- 

This week I completed my assignment of working on the What's New page in the Main Page of the website. I put more pictures in and helped grace make this page more organized. There are also now links back to the main page, which was another one of my assignments. However, one of my goals was to work on the formatting of the home page and I didn't get to that, so I am taking away a point from myself. However, I did help my scrum team get organized and look over the requirements to be sure we are all on the right track.

### Grace(20/20) - 
This week I was able to achieve my goals so I could work focus on next weeks assignment. My main goal was to work on the gallery slidehow. I wanted to able to allow the person shopping on the page to have an enjoyable experience. They could click through the images to see what foods there are available. I was able to start working on the beginning of the shopping car with billy. I added the headers and some text about the shopping cart. Our team was able to colleberate and give equal share of work to improve our project.

## Usage of Github
We used Github to share code so we could all make our own adjustments without messing up the main. 
## Usage of IntelliJ
We all tried to switch to this because Repl was giving us problems. Brayden switched from VS Code to InteliJ. We all followed along with the video from Dane in class this week
## Usage of Flask and routes
We used flask to make our webiste and we had many app.route so that when you click on the word, it brings you to a new webpage
## Usage of bootstrap
We used bootstrap while making our dropdown menu. 
## Usage of Jinja
We used jinja in the tastydeserts.html, where we passed a python list.
