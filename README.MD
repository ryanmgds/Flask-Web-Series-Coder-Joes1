Brayden  -  I helepd make this README.md and I added some pictures to this website. I also added links and I changed the github icon to take you to my github and the youtube icon to take you to YouTube.com. i added pictures to the static file so that we can use them. 
Billy  -   added to the read me and was able to customize the buttons and links to fit our project.The 2 parts I was assigned was the lunch and dessert pages and I did all of the code on those two templates. I also created our shopping bag icon and template.
Lola  -  I helped grace add to the "Whats new" page, helped with out logo for Coder Joes and added to the READ.ME. I am also working on the dinner page by adding prices, pictures, and recipes.
Ryan  -  I created the read.me and added links to the youtube icon and main store.

# Requirements we hit 



## Usage of Github
We used Github to share code so we could all make our own adjustments without messing up the main. 
## Usage of IntelliJ
We all tried to switch to this because Repl was giving us problems. Brayden switched from VS Code to InteliJ. We all followed along with the video from Dane in class this week
## Usage of Flask and routes
We used flask to make our webiste and we had many app.route so that when you click on the word, it brings you to a new webpage
## Usage of bootstrap
We used bootstrap while making our dropdown menu. 
## Usage of Jinja
